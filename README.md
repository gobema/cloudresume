# Cloud Resume

The `cloudresume` branch has a major update to the About page as well as a few minor textual changes to transition from
a Snippetbox to a Cloud Résumé.

The original [cloud résumé challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) included a blog post as
one of the requirements. I've written that story and added it to the About page of the web app. This is my first time
working with AWS CDK, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions, and I ran into some interesting challenges along the way.

As I write in the About page, my goal was a personal variation of the cloud résumé challenge. I chose to emphasize
day-to-day work on an existing code base and to produce a workflow that allowed me to deploy and destroy an application.

Once again, I'd like to gratefully mention the books [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/)
and [Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards. This project would not have been
possible without the Snippetbox code base from _Let's Go_ and all that I have learned about Go from both books.
